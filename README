Authorunknown fork notes:

    This was originally a fork of the excellent fitsharp library written by
    Mike Stockdale (git://github.com/jediwhale/fitsharp.git).

    My changes give you the ability to fully specify how the app domain that hosts
    your test code gets created.

    Whether or not this ever gets merged into the original project is up to Mr.
    Stockdale, but I will bring it up when it is finished and fully tested.
